In this prototype, we have a React component called MedicationReminderApp. It fetches Sunita's medications from an API (simulated here) and displays them in a list. Each medication item has a "Mark as Taken" button, which, when clicked, triggers the handleMedicationTaken function. In this function, you can add the logic to update the medication status as "taken" in the database or local storage.

Please note that this is a simplified prototype focusing on medication reminders. To create a complete application with features like user registration, profile creation, and health monitoring, you would need to design additional components and implement the necessary functionality.

Remember to set up the necessary project structure, install dependencies (such as react and react-dom), and configure a build process (e.g., using webpack or Create React App) before running this application.
